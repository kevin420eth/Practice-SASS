We need to install 4 npm packages below:
1.sass
2.gulp
3.gulp-sass
4.gulp-purgecss (optional)

What are these packages for?

sass:
A popular CSS preprocessor that allows you to write CSS code with more advanced features, such as variables, nesting, mixins, and functions. Sass code is then compiled into regular CSS code that can be used in web development.

gulp:
Gulp is a task runner that automates repetitive tasks in web development workflows. Gulp can be used to perform tasks such as minifying CSS and JavaScript files, optimizing images, compiling Sass code into CSS, and more. It uses a simple yet powerful API that allows developers to easily create and manage complex build workflows.

gulp-sass:
Gulp-sass is a plugin for Gulp that allows you to compile Sass code into CSS code. It provides a simple interface for configuring Sass compilation and supports various features such as source maps, autoprefixing, and error handling. Using gulp-sass with gulp can make it easier to automate the Sass compilation process and integrate it with other build tasks.

gulp-purgecss:
A plugin for Gulp that allows you to remove unused CSS code from your stylesheets.
